the details of i/o seem infinite. they probably are, since they are limited only by human inventiveness and capriciousness. for example, we have not considered the complexity implied by natural languages. what is written as 12.35 in english will be conventionally represented as 12,35 in most other european languages. naturally, the c++ standard library provides facilities for dealing with that and many other natural-language-specific aspects of i/o. 

how do you write chinese characters? how do you compare strings written using malayalam characters? there are answers, but they are far beyond the scope of this book. if you need to know, look in more specialized or advanced books (such as langer, standard c++ iostreams and locales, and stroustrup, the c++ programming language) and in library and system documentation. look for “locale”; that’s the term usually applied to facilities for dealing with natural language differences.
